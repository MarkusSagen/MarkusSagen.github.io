AI and Machine Learning Engineer Lead @ Dema.ai
I'm passionate about solving problems, finding efficient ways to solve the right problems and automating the problem when possible. 
Use the right tools for the job; machine learning is just one tool.

I like to work on hobby projects and learn in other domains and document those learnings.

### Currently learning:

- Zig
- Game Programming
- Raylib / SDL / GLFW
- Rust
- Prefect
- Kubernetes / ArgoCD
- FastHTML
- DuckDB
- Ibis
- UV
